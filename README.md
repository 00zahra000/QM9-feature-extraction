# QM9-feature-extraction

The aim of this project is to predict molecular properties. You are going to work
with molecular data and you have to predict 4 molecular properties, the Octanolwater partition coeffcient (logP), the number of rotatable bonds (RBN), the
molecular weight (MW) and the number of the rings (RN):

1. logP: represents a measure of the tendency of a compound to move from
the aqueous phase into lipids
2. Number of rotatable bonds (RBN): the number of bonds which allow free
rotation around themselves
3. Molecular weight (MW): the weight of a molecule based on the atomic
masses of all atoms in the molecule
4. Number of the rings (RN): the number of connected set of atoms and
bonds in which every atom and bond is a member of a cycle.
